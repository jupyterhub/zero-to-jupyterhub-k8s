# Notes about the GeneralPredicates

# Notes about the priorities
NodePreferAvoidPodsPriority: What does this really mean?
HardPodAffinitySymmetricWeight: "It represents the weight of implicit
PreferredDuringScheduling affinity rule." - preferred node affinity or preferred
pod/anti-pod affinity or those affinities in general? How does this relate to
the InterPodAffinityPriority and NodeAffinityPriority?

AlwaysCheckAllPredicates: scheduler checks all the configured predicates even
after one or more of them fails.

GeneralPredicates checks whether noncriticalPredicates and EssentialPredicates
pass. noncriticalPredicates are the predicates that only non-critical pods need
and EssentialPredicates are the predicates that all pods, including critical
pods, need

MostRequestedPriority: Is using the default MostRequestedPriorityMap that is a
priority function that favors nodes with most requested resources. It calculates
the percentage of memory and CPU requested by pods scheduled on the node, and
prioritizes based on the maximum of the average of the fraction of requested to
capacity.

Details: (cpu(10 * sum(requested) / capacity) + memory(10 * sum(requested) /
capacity)) / 2
