      fullnameOverride and nameOverride allow you to adjust how the resources
      part of the Helm chart are named.

      ```{admonition} Warning!
      :class: warning
      Changing fullnameOverride or nameOverride after the initial installation
      of the chart isn't supported. Changing their values likely leads to a
      reset of non-external JupyterHub databases, abandonment of users' storage,
      and severed couplings to currently running user pods.
      ```

      If you are a developer of a chart depending on this chart, you should
      avoid hardcoding names. If you want to reference the name of a resource in
      this chart from a parent helm chart's template, you can make use of the
      global named templates instead.

      ```yaml
      # some pod definition of a parent chart helm template
      schedulerName: {{ include "jupyterhub.user-scheduler.fullname" . }}
      ```

      To access them from a container, you can also rely on the hub ConfigMap
      that contains entries of all the resource names.

      ```yaml
      # some container definition in a parent chart helm template
      env:
        - name: SCHEDULER_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: {{ include "jupyterhub.user-scheduler.fullname" . }}
              key: user-scheduler
      ```
  nameOverride:
    type: string

      See the documentation under [`fullnameOverride`](schema_fullnameOverride).
  imagePullSecret:
    type: object
    description: |
      This is configuration to create a k8s Secret resource of `type:
      kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`, with credentials to pull images from a
      private image registry. If you opt to do so, it will be available for use
      by all pods in their respective `spec.imagePullSecrets` alongside other
      k8s Secrets defined in `imagePullSecrets` or the pod respective
      `...image.pullSecrets` configuration.

      In other words, using this configuration option can automate both the
      otherwise manual creation of a k8s Secret and the otherwise manual
      configuration to reference this k8s Secret in all the pods of the Helm
      chart.

      ```sh
      # you won't need to create a k8s Secret manually...
      kubectl create secret docker-registry image-pull-secret \
        --docker-server=<REGISTRY> \
        --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
        --docker-email=<EMAIL> \
        --docker-password=<PASSWORD>
      ```

      If you just want to let all Pods reference an existing secret, use the
      `imagePullSecrets` configuration instead.

          For gcr.io registries the password will be a big JSON blob for a
          Google cloud service account, it should look something like below.

          ```yaml
          password: |-

      This will not override or get overridden by pod specific configuration,
      but instead augment the pod specific configuration.

      You can use both the k8s native syntax, where each list element is like
      `{"name": "my-secret-name"}`, or you can let list elements be strings
      naming the secrets directly.

        description: |
          JupyterHub and its components (authenticators, spawners, etc), are
          Python classes that expose its configuration through
          [_traitlets_](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). With this
          Helm chart configuration (`hub.config`), you can directly configure
          the Python classes through _static_ YAML values. To _dynamically_ set
          values, you need to use [`hub.extraConfig`](schema_hub.extraConfig)
          instead.

          ```{admonition} Currently intended only for auth config
          :class: warning
          This config _currently_ (0.11.0) only influence the software in the
          `hub` Pod, but some Helm chart config options such as
          [`hub.baseUrl`](schema_hub.baseUrl) is used to set
          `JupyterHub.base_url` in the `hub` Pod _and_ influence how other Helm
          templates are rendered.

          As we have not yet mapped out all the potential configuration
          conflicts except for the authentication related configuration options,
          please accept that using it for something else at this point can lead
          to issues.
          ```

          __Example__

          If you inspect documentation or some `jupyterhub_config.py` to contain
          the following section:

          ```python
          c.JupyterHub.admin_access = true
          c.JupyterHub.admin_users = ["jovyan1", "jovyan2"]
          ```

          Then, you would be able to represent it with this configuration like:

          ```yaml
          hub:
            config:
              JupyterHub:
                admin_access: true
                admin_users:
                  - jovyan1
                  - jovyan2
          ```

          ```{admonition} YAML limitations
          :class: tip
          You can't represent Python `Bytes` or `Set` objects in YAML directly.
          ```

          ```{admonition} Helm value merging
          :class: tip
          `helm` merges a Helm chart's default values with values passed with
          the `--values` or `-f` flag. During merging, lists are replaced while

                # that must be unique.
                name: <explicit file name>

                # mode is by default 0644 and you can optionally override it
                # either by octal notation (example: 0400) or decimal notation
                # (example: 256).
                mode: <file system permissions>

                # mountPath is required and must be the directory you want to
                # mount the file.
                mountPath: <directory path>

                # Choose one out of the three ways to represent the actual file
                # content: data, stringData, or binaryData.
                #
                # Both stringData and binaryData should be set to a string
                # representing the content, where binaryData should be the
                # base64 encoding of the actual file content.
                #
                # data should be set to a mapping (dictionary). It will in the
                # end be rendered to either YAML, JSON, or TOML based on the

                # .json, or .toml.
                #
                # If your content is YAML, JSON, or TOML, it can be useful to

                # the files content from different files as compared to opting
                # for one or another string.
                #

          To avoid embedding entire files in the Helm chart configuration, you
          can use the `--set-file` flag during `helm upgrade` to set the
          stringData or binaryData field.

          ```yaml
          hub:
            extraFiles:
              # Explicitly set the name to avoid having the file key include a .
              # as it can hamper our ability to use --set-file.
              my_image:
                name: my_image.png
                mountPath: /usr/local/share/jupyterhub/static/

              # Files in /etc/jupyterhub.d are automatically loaded just like
              # hub.extraConfig entries, sorted based on their name.

          ```bash
          # --set-file expects a text based file, so you need to base64 encode
          # it manually first.
          base64 my_image.png > my_image.png.b64

          helm upgrade <...> \

          This is the equivalent of c.JupyterHub.base_url, but it is also needed

        description: |
          A list of strings to be used to replace the JupyterHub image's
          `ENTRYPOINT` entry. Note that in k8s lingo, the Dockerfile's
          `ENTRYPOINT` is called `command`. The list of strings will be expanded
          with Helm's template function `tpl` which can render Helm template
          logic inside curly braces (`{{... }}`).

          This could be useful to wrap the invocation of JupyterHub itself in
          some custom way.

          A list of strings to be used to replace the JupyterHub image's `CMD`
          entry as well as the Helm chart's default way to start JupyterHub.
          Note that in k8s lingo, the Dockerfile's `CMD` is called `args`. The
          list of strings will be expanded with Helm's template function `tpl`
          which can render Helm template logic inside curly braces (`{{... }}`).

          ```{warning}
          By replacing the entire configuration file, which is mounted to
          `/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py` by the Helm chart, instead of
          appending to it with `hub.extraConfig`, you expose your deployment for
          issues stemming from getting out of sync with the Helm chart's config
          file.

          These kind of issues will be significantly harder to debug and
          diagnose, and can due to this could cause a lot of time expenditure
          for both the community maintaining the Helm chart as well as yourself,
          even if this wasn't the reason for the issue.

          Due to this, we ask that you do your _absolute best to avoid replacing
          the default provided `jupyterhub_config.py` file. It can often be
          possible. For example, if your goal is to have a dedicated .py file
          for more extensive additions that you can syntax highlight and such
          and feel limited by passing code in `hub.extraConfig` which is part of
          a YAML file, you can use [this
          trick](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/1580#issuecomment-707776237)
          instead.

          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
          secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
          save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
          the hub container. A value set here will make JupyterHub overwrite any previous file.

          You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
          storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
          default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
          value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
          restarts.

          Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
          *immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised

              Type of database backend to use for the hub database.

              The Hub requires a persistent database to function, and this lets you specify
              where it should be stored.

              The various options are:

              1. **sqlite-pvc**

                 Use an `sqlite` database kept on a persistent volume attached to the hub.

                 By default, this disk is created by the cloud provider using
                 *dynamic provisioning* configured by a [storage
                 class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
                 You can customize how this disk is created / attached by
                 setting various properties under `hub.db.pvc`.

                 This is the default setting, and should work well for most cloud provider
                 deployments.

              2. **sqlite-memory**

                 Use an in-memory `sqlite` database. This should only be used for testing,
                 since the database is erased whenever the hub pod restarts - causing the hub
                 to lose all memory of users who had logged in before.

                 When using this for testing, make sure you delete all other objects that the
                 hub has created (such as user pods, user PVCs, etc) every time the hub restarts.
                 Otherwise you might run into errors about duplicate resources.

              3. **mysql**

                 Use an externally hosted mysql database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the mysql database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 mysql+pymysql://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

              4. **postgres**

                 Use an externally hosted postgres database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the postgres database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 postgres+psycopg2://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

            - Configure code running in the hub pod, such as an authenticator or
              spawner.

          String literals with `$(ENV_VAR_NAME)` will be expanded by Kubelet which
          is a part of Kubernetes.

      extraConfig:
        type: object
        description: |
          Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

          This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
          that is not present here as an option, you can write the raw Python to do it here.

          extraConfig is a *dict*, so there can be multiple configuration snippets
          under different names.
          The configuration sections are run in alphabetical order.

          Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
            - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
            - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
            - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
            - Anything else you can think of!

          Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
          [| operator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688).

          For example:
            ```yaml
            hub:
              extraConfig:
                myConfig.py: |
                  c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
                  c.Spawner.somethingelse = 'something else'
            ```

          No validation of this python is performed! If you make a mistake here, it will probably
          manifest as either the hub pod going into `Error` or `CrashLoopBackoff` states, or in
          some special cases, the hub running but... just doing very random things. Be careful!

          Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a user with this uid

          Defaults to 1000, which is the uid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the

          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to secure communications
          between the hub and the configurable-http-proxy.

          Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
          practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
          it to something else, or user data can be compromised.

      podPriority:
        type: object
        description: |
          Pod Priority is used to allow real users evict placeholder pods that
          in turn triggers a scale up by a cluster autoscaler. So, enabling this
          option will only make sense if the following conditions are met:

          1. Your Kubernetes cluster has at least version 1.11
          2. A cluster autoscaler is installed
          3. user-placeholer pods is configured to get a priority equal or
             higher than the cluster autoscaler's priority cutoff
          4. Normal user pods have a higher priority than the user-placeholder
             pods

          Note that if the default priority cutoff if not configured on cluster
          autoscaler, it will currently default to 0, and that in the future
          this is meant to be lowered. If your cloud provider is installing the
          cluster autoscaler for you, they may also configure this specifically.

          Recommended settings for a cluster autoscaler...

          ... with a priority cutoff of -10 (GKE):

          ```yaml
          podPriority:
            enabled: true
            globalDefault: false
            defaultPriority: 0
            userPlaceholderPriority: -10
          ```

          ... with a priority cutoff of 0:

          ```yaml
          podPriority:
            enabled: true
            globalDefault: true
            defaultPriority: 10
            userPlaceholderPriority: 0
          ```
        properties:
          enabled:
            type: bool
          globalDefault:
            type: bool
            description: |
              Warning! This will influence all pods in the cluster.

              The priority a pod usually get is 0. But this can be overridden
              with a PriorityClass resource if it is declared to be the global
              default. This configuration option allows for the creation of such
              global default.

              The actual value for the user-placeholder pods' priority.
      userPlaceholder:
        type: object
        description: |
          User placeholders simulate users but will thanks to PodPriority be
          evicted by the cluster autoscaler if a real user shows up. In this way
          placeholders allow you to create a headroom for the real users and
          reduce the risk of a user having to wait for a node to be added. Be
          sure to use the the continuous image puller as well along with
          placeholders, so the images are also available when real users arrive.

          To test your setup efficiently, you can adjust the amount of user
          placeholders with the following command:
          ```sh
          # Configure to have 3 user placeholders
          kubectl scale sts/user-placeholder --replicas=3
          ```

          podSchedulingWaitDuration:
            description: |
              The `hook-image-awaiter` has a criteria to await all the
              `hook-image-puller` DaemonSet's pods to both schedule and finish
              their image pulling. This flag can be used to relax this criteria
              to instead only await the pods that _has already scheduled_ to
              finish image pulling after a certain duration.

              The value of this is that sometimes the newly created
              `hook-image-puller` pods cannot be scheduled because nodes are
              full, and then it probably won't make sense to block a `helm
              upgrade`.

              An infinite duration to wait for pods to schedule can be
              represented by `-1`. This was the default behavior of version
              0.9.0 and earlier.

        description: |
          The singleuser.profileList configuration can let the user choose an
          image through the selection of a profile. This option determines if
          those images will be pulled, both by the hook and continuous pullers.

          The reason to disable this, is that if you have for example 10 images
          which start pulling in order from 1 to 10, a user that arrives and
          wants to start a pod with image number 10 will need to wait for all
          images to be pulled, and then it may be preferable to just let the
          user arriving wait for a single image to be pulled on arrival.
