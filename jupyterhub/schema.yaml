      ```{admonition} Warning!
      :class: warning
      Changing fullnameOverride or nameOverride after the initial installation
      of the chart isn't supported. Changing their values likely leads to a
      reset of non-external JupyterHub databases, abandonment of users' storage,
      and severed couplings to currently running user pods.
      ```

      If you are a developer of a chart depending on this chart, you should
      avoid hardcoding names. If you want to reference the name of a resource in
      this chart from a parent helm chart's template, you can make use of the
      global named templates instead.

      ```yaml
      # some pod definition of a parent chart helm template
      schedulerName: {{ include "jupyterhub.user-scheduler.fullname" . }}
      ```

      To access them from a container, you can also rely on the hub ConfigMap
      that contains entries of all the resource names.

      ```yaml
      # some container definition in a parent chart helm template
      env:
        - name: SCHEDULER_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: {{ include "jupyterhub.user-scheduler.fullname" . }}
              key: user-scheduler

        This is configuration to create a k8s Secret resource of `type:
        kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`, with credentials to pull images from a
        private image registry. If you opt to do so, it will be available for use
        by all pods in their respective `spec.imagePullSecrets` alongside other
        k8s Secrets defined in `imagePullSecrets` or the pod respective
        `...image.pullSecrets` configuration.

        In other words, using this configuration option can automate both the
        otherwise manual creation of a k8s Secret and the otherwise manual
        configuration to reference this k8s Secret in all the pods of the Helm
        chart.

        ```sh
        # you won't need to create a k8s Secret manually...
        kubectl create secret docker-registry image-pull-secret \
          --docker-server=<REGISTRY> \
          --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
          --docker-email=<EMAIL> \
          --docker-password=<PASSWORD>
        ```

        If you just want to let all Pods reference an existing secret, use the
        `imagePullSecrets` configuration instead.

          JupyterHub and its components (authenticators, spawners, etc), are
          Python classes that expose its configuration through
          [_traitlets_](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). With this
          Helm chart configuration (`hub.config`), you can directly configure
          the Python classes through _static_ YAML values. To _dynamically_ set
          values, you need to use [`hub.extraConfig`](schema_hub.extraConfig)
          instead.

          ```{admonition} Currently intended only for auth config
          :class: warning
          This config _currently_ (0.11.0) only influence the software in the
          `hub` Pod, but some Helm chart config options such as
          [`hub.baseUrl`](schema_hub.baseUrl) is used to set
          `JupyterHub.base_url` in the `hub` Pod _and_ influence how other Helm
          templates are rendered.

          As we have not yet mapped out all the potential configuration
          conflicts except for the authentication related configuration options,
          please accept that using it for something else at this point can lead
          to issues.
          ```

          __Example__

          If you inspect documentation or some `jupyterhub_config.py` to contain
          the following section:

          ```python
          c.JupyterHub.admin_access = true
          c.JupyterHub.admin_users = ["jovyan1", "jovyan2"]
          ```

          Then, you would be able to represent it with this configuration like:

          ```yaml
          hub:
            config:
              JupyterHub:
                admin_access: true
                admin_users:
                  - jovyan1
                  - jovyan2
          ```

          ```{admonition} YAML limitations
          :class: tip
          You can't represent Python `Bytes` or `Set` objects in YAML directly.

          ```{admonition} Helm value merging

                # mountPath is required and must be the absolute file path.
                mountPath: <full file path>

                # Choose one out of the three ways to represent the actual file
                # content: data, stringData, or binaryData.
                #
                # data should be set to a mapping (dictionary). It will in the
                # end be rendered to either YAML, JSON, or TOML based on the

                # .json, or .toml.
                #
                # If your content is YAML, JSON, or TOML, it can make sense to
                # use data to represent it over stringData as data can be merged

                # base64 encoding of the actual file content.
                #
                data:
                  myConfig:
                    myMap:

                  hello world!
                binaryData: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQhCg==

                # mode is by default 0644 and you can optionally override it
                # either by octal notation (example: 0400) or decimal notation
                # (example: 256).
                mode: <file system permissions>
          ```

          **Using --set-file**

          To avoid embedding entire files in the Helm chart configuration, you
          can use the `--set-file` flag during `helm upgrade` to set the
          stringData or binaryData field.

          ```yaml
          hub:
            extraFiles:
              my_image:
                mountPath: /usr/local/share/jupyterhub/static/my_image.png

              # Files in /usr/local/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.d are
              # automatically loaded in alphabetical order of the final file
              # name when JupyterHub starts.
              my_config:
                mountPath: /usr/local/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.d/my_jupyterhub_config.py
          ```

          ```bash
          # --set-file expects a text based file, so you need to base64 encode
          # it manually first.
          base64 my_image.png > my_image.png.b64

          helm upgrade <...> \
              --set-file hub.extraFiles.my_image.binaryData=./my_image.png.b64 \
              --set-file hub.extraFiles.my_config.stringData=./my_jupyterhub_config.py
          ```

          **Common uses**

          1. **JupyterHub template customization**

             You can replace the default JupyterHub user interface templates in
             the hub pod by injecting new ones to
             `/usr/local/share/jupyterhub/templates`. These can in turn
             reference custom images injected to
             `/usr/local/share/jupyterhub/static`.

          1. **JupyterHub standalone file config**

             Instead of embedding JupyterHub python configuration as a string
             within a YAML file through
             [`hub.extraConfig`](schema_hub.extraConfig), you can inject a
             standalone .py file into
             `/usr/local/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.d` that is
             automatically loaded.

          1. **Flexible configuration**

             By injecting files, you don't have to embed them in a docker image
             that you have to rebuild.

             If your configuration file is a YAML/JSON/TOML file, you can also
             use `data` instead of `stringData` which allow you to set various
             configuration in separate Helm config files. This can be useful to
             help dependent charts override only some configuration part of the
             file, or to allow for the configuration be set through multiple
             Helm configuration files.

          **Limitations**

          1. File size

             The files in `hub.extraFiles` and `singleuser.extraFiles` are
             respectively stored in their own k8s Secret resource. As k8s
             Secret's are limited, typically to 1MB, you will be limited to a
             total file size of less than 1MB as there is also base64 encoding
             that takes place reducing available capacity to 75%.

          2. File updates

             The files that are mounted are only set during container startup.
             This is [because we use
             `subPath`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#secret)
             as is required to avoid replacing the content of the entire
             directory we mount in.

          This could be useful to wrap the invocation of JupyterHub itself in

          list of strings will be expanded with Helm's template function `tpl`
          which can render Helm template logic inside curly braces (`{{... }}`).

          ```{warning}
          By replacing the entire configuration file, which is mounted to
          `/usr/local/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py` by the Helm chart,
          instead of appending to it with `hub.extraConfig`, you expose your
          deployment for issues stemming from getting out of sync with the Helm
          chart's config file.

          These kind of issues will be significantly harder to debug and
          diagnose, and can due to this could cause a lot of time expenditure
          for both the community maintaining the Helm chart as well as yourself,
          even if this wasn't the reason for the issue.

          Due to this, we ask that you do your _absolute best to avoid replacing
          the default provided `jupyterhub_config.py` file. It can often be
          possible. For example, if your goal is to have a dedicated .py file
          for more extensive additions that you can syntax highlight and such
          and feel limited by passing code in `hub.extraConfig` which is part of
          a YAML file, you can use [this
          trick](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/1580#issuecomment-707776237)
          instead.

          ```{note}
          As of version 1.0.0 this will automatically be generated and there is
          no need to set it manually.

          If you wish to reset a generated key, you can use `kubectl edit` on
          the k8s Secret typically named `hub` and remove the
          `hub.config.JupyterHub.cookie_secret` entry in the k8s Secret, then
          perform a new `helm upgrade`.
          ```

          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
          secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
          save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
          the hub container. A value set here will make JupyterHub overwrite any previous file.

          You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
          storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
          default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
          value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
          restarts.

          Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
          *immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised

      db:

            description: |
              Type of database backend to use for the hub database.

              The Hub requires a persistent database to function, and this lets you specify
              where it should be stored.

              The various options are:

              1. **sqlite-pvc**

                 Use an `sqlite` database kept on a persistent volume attached to the hub.

                 By default, this disk is created by the cloud provider using
                 *dynamic provisioning* configured by a [storage
                 class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
                 You can customize how this disk is created / attached by
                 setting various properties under `hub.db.pvc`.

                 This is the default setting, and should work well for most cloud provider
                 deployments.

              2. **sqlite-memory**

                 Use an in-memory `sqlite` database. This should only be used for testing,
                 since the database is erased whenever the hub pod restarts - causing the hub
                 to lose all memory of users who had logged in before.

                 When using this for testing, make sure you delete all other objects that the
                 hub has created (such as user pods, user PVCs, etc) every time the hub restarts.
                 Otherwise you might run into errors about duplicate resources.

              3. **mysql**

                 Use an externally hosted mysql database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the mysql database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 mysql+pymysql://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

              4. **postgres**

                 Use an externally hosted postgres database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the postgres database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 postgresql+psycopg2://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

              5. **other**

                 Use an externally hosted database of some kind other than mysql
                 or postgres.

                 When using _other_, the database password must be passed as
                 part of [hub.db.url](schema_hub.db.url) as
                 [hub.db.password](schema_hub.db.password) will be ignored.

      extraConfig:

        additionalProperties: true
        description: |
          Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

          This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
          that is not present here as an option, you can write the raw Python to do it here.

          extraConfig is a *dict*, so there can be multiple configuration
          snippets under different names. The configuration sections are run in
          alphabetical order based on the keys.

          Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
            - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
            - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
            - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
            - Anything else you can think of!

          Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
          [| operator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#23-scalars).

          For example:

          ```yaml
          hub:
            extraConfig:
              myConfig.py: |
                c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
                c.Spawner.something_else = 'something else'
          ```

          ```{note}
          No code validation is performed until JupyterHub loads it! If you make
          a typo here, it will probably manifest itself as the hub pod failing
          to start up and instead entering an `Error` state or the subsequent
          `CrashLoopBackoff` state.

          To make use of your own programs linters etc, it would be useful to
          not embed Python code inside a YAML file. To do that, consider using
          [`hub.extraFiles`](schema_hub.extraFiles) and mounting a file to
          `/usr/local/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.d` in order to load your
          extra configuration logic.

          This is where you register JupyterHub services. For details on how to
          configure these services in this Helm chart just keep reading but for
          details on services themselves instead read [JupyterHub's
          documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/service.html).

          ```{note}
          Only a selection of JupyterHub's configuration options that can be
          configured for a service are documented below. All configuration set
          here will be applied even if this Helm chart doesn't recognize it.
          ```

          JupyterHub's native configuration accepts a list of service objects,
          this Helm chart only accept a dictionary where each key represents the
          name of a service and the value is the actual service objects.

          When configuring JupyterHub services via this Helm chart, the `name`
          field can be omitted as it can be implied by the dictionary key.
          Further, the `api_token` field can be omitted as it will be
          automatically generated as of version 1.1.0 of this Helm chart.

          If you have an external service that needs to access the automatically
          generated api_token for the service, you can access it from the `hub`
          k8s Secret part of this Helm chart under the key
          `hub.services.my-service-config-key.apiToken`.

          Here is an example configuration of two services where the first
          explicitly sets a name and api_token, while the second omits those and
          lets the name be implied from the key name and the api_token be
          automatically generated.

          ```yaml
          hub:
            services:
              my-service-1:
                admin: true
                name: my-explicitly-set-service-name
                api_token: my-explicitly-set-api_token

              # the name of the following service will be my-service-2
              # the api_token of the following service will be generated
              my-service-2: {}
          ```

          If you develop a Helm chart depending on the JupyterHub Helm chart and
          want to let some Pod's environment variable be populated with the
          api_token of a service registered like above, then do something along
          these lines.

          ```yaml
          # ... container specification of a pod ...
          env:
            - name: MY_SERVICE_1_API_TOKEN
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  # Don't hardcode the name, use the globally accessible
                  # named templates part of the JupyterHub Helm chart.
                  name: {{ include "jupyterhub.hub.fullname" . }}
                  # Note below the use of the configuration key my-service-1
                  # rather than the explicitly set service name.
                  key: hub.services.my-service-1.apiToken
          ```
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
            description: |
              The name can be implied via the key name under which this
              service is configured, and is due to that allowed to be

              The api_token will be automatically generated if not

              part of this Helm chart under a specific key.

      loadRoles:
        type: object

        description: |
          This is where you should define JupyterHub roles and apply them to
          JupyterHub users, groups, and services to grant them additional
          permissions as defined in JupyterHub's RBAC system.

          Complement this documentation with [JupyterHub's
          documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rbac/roles.html#defining-roles)
          about `load_roles`.

          Note that while JupyterHub's native configuration `load_roles` accepts
          a list of role objects, this Helm chart only accepts a dictionary where
          each key represents the name of a role and the value is the actual
          role object.

          ```yaml
          hub:
            loadRoles:
              teacher:
                description: Access to users' information and group membership

                # this role provides permissions to...
                scopes: [users, groups]

                # this role will be assigned to...
                users: [erik]
                services: [grading-service]
                groups: [teachers]
          ```

          When configuring JupyterHub roles via this Helm chart, the `name`
          field can be omitted as it can be implied by the dictionary key.

          Arbitrary extra k8s pod specification as a YAML object. The default
          value of this setting is an empty object, i.e. no extra configuration.
          The value of this property is augmented to the pod specification as-is.

          This is a powerful tool for expert k8s administrators with advanced
          configuration requirements. This setting should only be used for
          configuration that cannot be accomplished through the other settings.
          Misusing this setting can break your deployment and/or compromise
          your system security.

          This is one of four related settings for inserting arbitrary pod
          specification:

          1. hub.extraPodSpec
          2. proxy.chp.extraPodSpec
          3. proxy.traefik.extraPodSpec
          4. scheduling.userScheduler.extraPodSpec

          One real-world use of these settings is to enable host networking. For
          example, to configure host networking for the hub pod, add the
          following to your helm configuration values:

          ```yaml
          hub:
            extraPodSpec:
              hostNetwork: true
              dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
          ```

          Likewise, to configure host networking for the proxy pod, add the
          following:

          ```yaml
          proxy:
            chp:
              extraPodSpec:
                hostNetwork: true
                dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
          ```

          N.B. Host networking has special security implications and can easily
          break your deployment. This is an example—not an endorsement.

                    - "--custom-header {{ .Values.myCustomStuff }}"
              ```

              Note that these will be appended last, and if you provide the same
              flag twice, the last flag will be used, which mean you can
              override the default flag values as well.

              or produce more informative error messages than the Hub's default,

          ```{note}
          As of version 1.0.0 this will automatically be generated and there is
          no need to set it manually.

          If you wish to reset a generated key, you can use `kubectl edit` on
          the k8s Secret typically named `hub` and remove the
          `hub.config.ConfigurableHTTPProxy.auth_token` entry in the k8s Secret,
          then perform a new `helm upgrade`.
          ```

          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to
          secure communications between the hub pod and the proxy pod running a
          [configurable-http-proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy)
          instance.

          ```sh
          # to generate a value, run
          openssl rand -hex 32
          ```

          Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
          practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
          it to something else, or user data can be compromised.

          As an example of when this is needed, consider if you want to enable
          sudo rights for some of your users. This can be done by starting up as
          root, enabling it from the container in a startup script, and then
          transitioning to the normal user.

        description: |
          Pod Priority is used to allow real users evict user placeholder pods
          that in turn by entering a Pending state can trigger a scale up by a
          cluster autoscaler.

          Having this option enabled only make sense if the following conditions
          are met:

          1. A cluster autoscaler is installed.
          2. user-placeholer pods are configured to have a priority equal or
             higher than the cluster autoscaler's "priority cutoff" so that the
             cluster autoscaler scales up a node in advance for a pending user
             placeholder pod.
          3. Normal user pods have a higher priority than the user-placeholder
             pods.
          4. Image puller pods have a priority between normal user pods and
             user-placeholder pods.

          Note that if the default priority cutoff if not configured on cluster
          autoscaler, it will currently default to 0, and that in the future
          this is meant to be lowered. If your cloud provider is installing the
          cluster autoscaler for you, they may also configure this specifically.

          Recommended settings for a cluster autoscaler...

          ... with a priority cutoff of -10 (GKE):

          ```yaml
          podPriority:

            userPlaceholderPriority: -10
          ```

          ... with a priority cutoff of 0:

          podPriority:
            enabled: true
            globalDefault: true

          User placeholders simulate users but will thanks to PodPriority be

          placeholders, so the images are also available when real users arrive.

          To test your setup efficiently, you can adjust the amount of user
          placeholders with the following command:

          podSchedulingWaitDuration:
            description: |
              The `hook-image-awaiter` has a criteria to await all the

              their image pulling. This flag can be used to relax this criteria
              to instead only await the pods that _has already scheduled_ to
              finish image pulling after a certain duration.

              The value of this is that sometimes the newly created
              `hook-image-puller` pods cannot be scheduled because nodes are
              full, and then it probably won't make sense to block a `helm
              upgrade`.

              An infinite duration to wait for pods to schedule can be
              represented by `-1`. This was the default behavior of version
              0.9.0 and earlier.

          The reason to disable this, is that if you have for example 10 images
          which start pulling in order from 1 to 10, a user that arrives and
          wants to start a pod with image number 10 will need to wait for all
          images to be pulled, and then it may be preferable to just let the
          user arriving wait for a single image to be pulled on arrival.
