# Kubernetes on Red Hat OpenShift

[OpenShift](https://www.okd.io/) from RedHat is a cluster manager based on Kubernetes.

For setting up JupyterHub on OpenShift, check out the [JupyterHub on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyterhub-quickstart)
project. It provides an OpenShift template based JupyterHub deployment. Zero to JupyterHub uses
[helm](https://helm.sh) which is currently usable with OpenShift; yet deploying helm on OpenShift
is somewhat complicated (see RedHat's blog post on [Getting Started with Helm on OpenShift](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/getting-started-helm-openshift)).

## Additional resources about Jupyter on OpenShift

- An excellent series of OpenShift blog posts on Jupyter and OpenShift
  authored by Red Hat developer, Graham Dumpleton, are
  available on the [OpenShift blog](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/jupyter-openshift-using-openshift-data-analytics).
