#
# chartpress is used to:
# - Build images
# - Update Chart.yaml (version) and values.yaml (image tags)
# - Package and publish Helm charts to a GitHub based Helm chart repository
#
# For more information, see the projects README.md file:
# https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress

    # baseVersion should be a -0.dev suffixed version, where the version should
    # be the next major, minor, or patch version depending on what we have
    # merged so far into the main branch. If for example we have merged a
    # breaking change it should be the next major version, like 3.0.0-0.dev.

    # baseVersion should be managed via tbump, see RELEASE.md for details
