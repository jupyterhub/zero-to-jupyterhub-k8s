            A rebuild of `${{ steps.image.outputs.name }}` has been found to influence the detected vulnerabilities! This PR will trigger a rebuild because it has updated a comment in the Dockerfile.
            
            ## About
            This scan for known vulnerabilities has been made by [aquasecurity/trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy). Trivy was configured to filter the vulnerabilities with the following settings:
            - severity:       `CRITICAL,HIGH`
            - ignore-unfixed: `true`

            ## Before
            Before trying to rebuild the image, the following vulnerabilities was detected in `${{ steps.image.outputs.spec }}`.

            ${{ steps.analyze.outputs.md_summary_1 }}

            ## After
            ${{ steps.analyze.outputs.md_summary_2 }}
          commit-message: |
            Patch known vulnerability in ${{ matrix.image_ref }}
