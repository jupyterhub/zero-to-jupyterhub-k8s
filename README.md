# Zero to Jupyterhub with Kubernetes

**This is a work in process.**

*This documentation is currently useful for guidance not detailed instructions.*

## Purpose
This repository will contain the documentation source code for people to get started with
JupyterHub using Kubernetes. This document about deploying JupyterHub using Kubernetes
supplements the [JupyterHub project documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io).
It's our hope that the two documents will assist you in getting up and running with your
own JupyterHub deployment.

## History and inspiration

Much of the intial groundwork for this documentation is information learned from
the successful use of JupyterHub and Kubernetes at UC Berkeley in their
[Data 8](http://data8.org/) program.

## Documentation hosting

We will host this documentation on Read The Docs as we move forward and may also
host a mirror at a the corresponding
website (see the link at the top of our github repo page).
The [JupyterHub project documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io) as well
as documentation about authenticators, spawners, and services can be found on
ReadTheDocs.
