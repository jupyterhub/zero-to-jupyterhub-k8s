Step Zero: Kubernetes on Red Hat OpenShift
------------------------------------------

`OpenShift <https://www.okd.io/>`_ from RedHat is a cluster manager based on Kubernetes.

For setting up JupyterHub on OpenShift, check out the `JupyterHub on OpenShift <https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyterhub-quickstart>`_
project. It provides an OpenShift template based JupyterHub deployment. Zero to JupyterHub uses
`helm <https://helm.sh>`_ which is currently usable with OpenShift; yet deploying helm on OpenShift
is somewhat complicated (see RedHat's blog post on `Getting Started with Helm on OpenShift <https://blog.openshift.com/getting-started-helm-openshift/>`_).

  authored by Red Hat developer, Graham Dumpleton, are
  available on the `OpenShift blog <https://blog.openshift.com/tag/jupyter/>`_.
