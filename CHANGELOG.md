## [0.4] - [Akram](#akram) - 2017-06-23

Stability, HTTPS & breaking changes.

### Installation and upgrades

We **recommend** that you delete prior versions of the package and install the
latest version. If you are very familiar with Kubernetes, you can upgrade from
an older version, but we still suggest deleting and recreating your
installation.

### Breaking changes

* The **name of a user pod** and a **dynamically created home directory [PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)** no longer include
  the `userid` in them by default. If you are using dynamic PVCs for `home`
  directories (which is the default), you will need to *manually rename* these
  directories before upgrading.
  Otherwise, new PVCs will be created, and users might freak out when viewing the newly created directory and think that their home directory appears empty.

  See [PR #56](https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/56) on
  what needs to change.

* A **[StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#storageclasses)**
  is no longer created by default. This shouldn't affect most new installs,
  since most cloud provider installations have a default (as of Kubernetes 1.6).
  If you are using an older version of Kubernetes, the easiest thing to do is to
  upgrade to a newer version. If not, you can create a StorageClass manually
  and everything should continue to work.

* `token.proxy` is removed. Use **`proxy.secretToken`** instead.
  If your `config.yaml` contains something that looks like the following:

  ```yaml
  token:
      proxy: <some-secret>
  ```

  you should change that to:

  ```yaml
  proxy:
      secretToken: <some-secret>
  ```

### Added

* Added **GitHub Authentication support**, thanks to [Jason Kuruzovich](https://github.com/jkuruzovich).
* Added **[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) support**!
  If your cluster already has Ingress support (with automatic Let's Encrypt support, perhaps),
  you can easily use that now.
* We now add a **label** to user pods / PVCs with their usernames.
* Support using a **static PVC** for user `home` directories or for the hub database. This makes this release usable
  with clusters where you only have one NFS share that must be used for the whole hub.
* **PostgreSQL** is now a supported hub database backend provider.
* You can set annotations & labels on the **proxy-public service** now.

### Changed

* We now use the official [configurable http proxy](http://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy)
  (CHP) as the proxy, rather than the unofficial
  [nchp](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-nginx-chp). This should be a
  no-op (or require no changes) for the most part. JupyterHub errors might
  display a nicer error page.
* The version of KubeSpawner uses the official Kubernetes
  [python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/) rather
  than [pycurl](http://pycurl.io/). This helps with scalability a little.

### Removed

* The deprecated `createNamespace` parameter no longer works, alongside the
  deprecated `name` parameter. You probably weren't using these anyway - they
  were kept only for backwards compatibility with very early versions.
