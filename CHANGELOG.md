## [0.10]

### [0.10.0] - 2020-10-29

This release makes the deployment more robust, and enhances users ability to
configure the Helm chart in general. Some defaults have been changed allowing
the Helm chart to easier comply with PodSecurityPolicies by default.

#### Breaking changes:

- Anyone relying on configuration in the `proxy.https` section are now
  explicitly required to set `proxy.https.enabled` to `true`.

- Anyone using `hub.imagePullSecret` or `singleuser.imagePullSecret` should now
  instead use the chart wide `imagePullSecret` with the same syntax which will
  be helping all the JupyterHub pod's get images from a private image registry.
  For more information, see [the configuration
  reference](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/reference.html#imagepullsecret).

- Predefined Kubernetes
  [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
  are now created by default, explicitly describing allowed incoming (_ingress_)
  and outgoing (_egress_) network communication for the hub, proxy, and user
  pods. These `NetworkPolicy` resources are very permissive on the outgoing
  traffic (egress), but is limiting the incoming traffic to what is known to be
  needed.
  
  Note that these NetworkPolicies only influence network communication in a
  Kubernetes cluster if a NetworkPolicy controller enforce them, such as Calico.

  Also note that if network policies are enforced, you can safely stop actively
  blocking access to so called cloud metadata servers for the user pods by
  setting `singleuser.cloudMetadata.blockWithIptables=false`.

  See the [security
  documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administrator/security.html#kubernetes-network-policies)
  and the [configuration
  reference](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/reference.html#proxy-chp-networkpolicy)
  for more details.

- The Helm chart configuration `proxy.networkPolicy` has been removed,
  `proxy.chp.networkPolicy` (proxy pod) and `proxy.traefik.networkPolicy`
  (autohttps pod) must be used instead.

- The Helm chart configuration `proxy.containerSecurityContext` is renamed to
  `proxy.chp.containerSecurityContext`.

- The k8s ConfigMap `hub-config` k8s Secret `hub-secret` are now merged into
  `hub-secret`, which will affect anyone who use the `hub.existingSecret`
  option.

#### Release highlights

- **Environment variables in pods with K8S config**. An ability to configure environment variables in pods with a k8s native syntax
  has been added. This allows you to reference and mount a field in a k8s Secret
  as an environment variable for example. For more information, read [about
  extraEnv](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/reference.html#singleuser-extraenv)
  in the configuration reference.
- **Configure secrets for all pods via the helm chart**. imagePullSecrets for all the pods in the Helm chart can now be configured
  chart wide. See the configuration reference about
  [imagePullSecret](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/reference.html#imagepullsecret)
  and
  [imagePullSecrets](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/reference.html#imagepullsecrets)
  for more details.
- **Pod security is easier to use and configure**. Deploying the Helm chart in a cluster with a PodSecurityPolicy active is now
  easier, because the pods' containers now have `securityContext` set on them to
  run with relatively low permissions which are also configurable if needed.
- **More reliable TLS certificates**. The `autohttps` pod that is running to acquire TLS certificates if
  `proxy.https.type=letsencrypt` is now more reliably acquiring certificates. If
  you currently have such issue, do `kubectl delete deploy/autohttps` and
  `kubectl delete secret proxy-public-tls-acme` and then deploy the Helm chart
  again with `helm upgrade`.

## [0.9]

### [0.9.0] - 2020-04-15

#### Release summary

This Helm chart release is mainly a maintenance release featuring the latest
JupyterHub (1.1.0) and authenticators along with bug fixes and some additional
helpful configuration options.

Noteworthy:
- An issue with automatic acquisition of HTTPS certificates has been resolved
  since 0.9.0-beta.3.
- Fixed a compatibility issue with Kubernetes 1.16+
- The `images/hub/requirements.txt` file in this repo can now be used to track
  what specific version has been used at any point in time.
- [jupyterhub-nativeauthenticator](https://native-authenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) added to the JupyterHub Docker image.

Bumped dependencies:
- jupyterhub version 1.1.0
- jupyterhub-ldapauthenticator version 1.3.0
- jupyterhub-kubespawner version 0.11.1
- oauthenticator version 0.11.0
- kubernetes version 10.0.1

#### Upgrade instructions (IMPORTANT)

1. If you are using Helm 2, upgrade to the latest Helm 2 version. And if you are
   using Helm 3, upgrade to the latest Helm 3 version.
   
   Upgrading to Helm 3 from Helm 2 requires additional steps not covered here,
   so for now please stay with your current major version of helm (2 or 3).

   ```
   # Figure out what version you currently have locally, you should use
   # release of the same major version you have used before.
   helm version
   ```

   Install either the latest [Helm
   2](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm) or [Helm
   3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) depending on what major version you
   currently had worked with.

   ```
   # verify you successfully upgraded helm
   helm version

   # if you just upgraded helm 2, also upgrade tiller
   helm init --upgrade --service-account=tiller
   ```

2. Use `--cleanup-on-fail` when using `helm upgrade`.

   Helm can enter a problematic state by a `helm` install or upgrade process
   which started creating Kubernetes resources, but then didn't finish at all or
   didn't finish successfully. It can cause resources created that helm will
   later come in conflict with.

   To mitigate this, we suggest always using `--cleanup-on-fail` with this Helm
   chart, it is a solid behavior that reduce a lot of head ache.

3. If you use `--wait`, or `--atomic` which implies `--wait`: do not manually
   cancel the upgrade!

   If you would abort the upgrade when using `--wait` and Kubernetes resources
   has been created, resources will have been created that can cause conflict
   with future upgrades and require you to manually clean them up.

4. Delete resources that could cause issues before upgrading.

   ```shell
   # replace <NAMESPACE> below with where jupyterhub is installed
   kubectl delete -n <NAMESPACE> clusterrole,clusterrolebinding,role,rolebinding,serviceaccount,deployment,configmap,service -l component=autohttps
   ```

#### Troubleshooting upgrade

If you get an error similar to the one below, it is a symptom of having
attempted a `helm upgrade` that failed where helm lost track of some newly
created resources. A good solution is to delete all of these resources and try
again.

```shell
# replace <NAMESPACE> below with where jupyterhub is installed
kubectl delete -n <NAMESPACE> clusterrole,clusterrolebinding,role,rolebinding,serviceaccount,deployment,configmap,service -l component=autohttps
```

To avoid this in the future, use `--cleanup-on-fail` with the `helm upgrade`
command. It is not a fool proof way to avoid it, but . And note that even if that flag is used, an interupption for example during `--wait` or `--atomic` which implies `--wait`, be

## [0.8]

### [0.8.2] - 2019-04-01

Bumped the underlying JupyterHub to 0.9.6.

### [0.8.1] - 2019-03-28

Bumped the underlying JupyterHub to 0.9.5.

### [0.8.0] - [Richie Benaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Benaud) - 2019-01-24

This release contains JupyterHub version 0.9.4. It requires Kubernetes >= 1.11 and Helm >= 2.11.0.
See [the Helm Chart repository](https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart#release-notes) for
a list of relevant dependencies for all Helm Chart versions.

It contains new features, additional configuration options, and bug fixes.

#### Upgrading from 0.7

To upgrade your cluster:

1. backup your hub-db-dir persistent volume and previous configuration files, to be safe
2. read changes here and make any needed updates to your configuration
3. upgrade the chart:

    helm repo update
    helm upgrade $RELEASE --force --version 0.8.0 --values config.yaml

The `--force` flag allows deletion and recreation of objects
that have certain changes, such as different labels,
which are forbidden otherwise.

#### Breaking changes

- Github organisation OAuth: `auth.github.org_whitelist` has been renamed to `auth.github.orgWhitelist` to be consistent with helm's camelCase style


#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with upgrades, check for changed configuration in this document, and make sure your config is up to date.

If you aren't able to get the upgrade to work,
you can [rollback](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-rollback)
to a previous version with:

    helm rollback $RELEASE


Feel free to [ping us on gitter](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)
if you have problems or questions.

#### New Features

##### Easier user-selectable profiles upon login

Profile information is now passed through to KubeSpawner. This means you can
[specify multiple user profiles that users can select from](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-environment.html?highlight=profile#allow-users-to-create-their-own-conda-environments)
when they log in. ([#402](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/402))

##### Configurable image pull secrets

Improvements to the Helm Chart to let users specify private information that lets
the Hub pull from private Docker registries. New information includes
Kubernetes Secrets, an email field, large JSON blobs in the password field (required
in order to pull from a private gcr.io registry from an external cluster).

It also ensures that the image puller DaemonSets have the same credentials to pull the images.

(thanks to @AlexMorreale) #851

##### Improved user scheduling and resource management

#891

Want to make your autoscheduler work efficiently? Then you should schedule pods to pack tight instead of spread out. The user scheduler accomplishes this.


- **Pod priority and User placeholders** - #929

Want to scale up before users arrive so they don't end up waiting for the node to pull an image of several gigabytes in size? By adding a configurable fixed amount of user placeholder pods with a lower [pod priority](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/) than real user pods, we can accomplish this. It requires k8s v1.11 though.


- **preferScheduleNextToRealUsers - improves autoscaling** - #930
  This setting slightly improves the ability for a cluster autoscaler to scale down by increasing the likelihood of user placeholders being left alone on a node rather than real users. Real users can't be moved around while user placeholder pods can

#### Minor upgrades and development improvements

- **Update jupyterhub to 0.9.4**
- **Update kubespawner to 0.10.1**
- **Allow setting of storage labels** - #924
- **Tolerations for node taints** - #925
- **Making the core and user pods affinity have configurable presets** - #927
- **Improved linting and validation + CI integration** - #844
- **Improved CI tests** - #846
- **Cleanup of orphaned files** - #842
  Two files were left unused in the repo.
- **cull.maxAge bugfix** - #853
  `cull.maxAge` previously didn't influence the culler service, as the value was never consumed. This is fixed by a single one line commit in a PR.
- **No more duplicates of puller pods** - #854
  Nobody wants pods running that does nothing. By using the new `before-hook-creation` value for the `deletion-policy` Helm hook together with a single name for our Helm hook resources, we can ensure never having orphaned image pullers.
- **Remove pod-culler image** - #890 #919
  Before JupyterHub 0.9 the pod-culler was a standalone pod with a custom image. But now it is a internal service of the JupyterHub pod, so in this PR we slim the remnant code.
- **Upgrade to k8s 1.9 APIs** - #920
  Migrate to more stable K8s resource APIs from `beta`.
- **Update of the singleuser-sample image** - #888
  `git` and `nbgitpuller` are now available by default
- **Switch to using a StatefulSet for the Hub** __*__
  The Hub should perhaps be a StatefulSet rather than a Deployment as it tends to be tied to a PV that can only be mounted by one single Hub. See this issue: https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/1863
- Show users deprecation and error messages when they use certain deprecated
  configuration (e.g. `hub.extraConfig` as a single string)
  or incompatible combinations.
- **Updates to the guide** - #850
- **Updates to inline documentation** - #939

#### [Richie Benaud](https://www.cricket.com.au/players/richie-benaud/gvp5xSjUp0q6Qd7IM5TbCg)

_(excerpt from https://www.cricket.com.au/players/richie-benaud/gvp5xSjUp0q6Qd7IM5TbCg)_

Possibly the most iconic man in Australian cricket, Richie Benaud enjoyed a career spanning nearly
70 years in the game. On the field, he scored 767 runs at 19.66 in his 27 matches against England,
while he also picked up 83 wickets. Off the field,
he has been just as important. His commentary has been second to none since making his radio debut in 1960.

While playing for Australia, fans flocked to the cricket to watch Benaud led sides
dominate whoever they played. The late 1950’s to early 1960’s was a golden period in
Australian cricket, with players such as Simpson, Lawry and Harvey
scoring runs, while Benaud and Davidson did the damage with the ball.

Richie Benaud was responsible for resurrecting cricket in this country. The world was
changing at that time, and so was cricket. It was being shown on television for the
first time, while radio coverage was becoming more advanced. Benaud
felt he had a duty to the Australian public to make the game more entertaining. Sure,
you could argue that the 1961 series was dull, but at least Australia
retained the Ashes. Nobody will forget the tied Test against the West Indies, or Benaud’s
audacious move to bowl around the wicket in Manchester.

Benaud is credited with popularising the tactics we see today. Huddles after a wicket
were born in the Benaud era. Declaring just before stumps in a bid to steal a late wicket
was something he thrived upon. Bowling into the rough is now seen
as common practice.

Benaud was also prepared to try new things with the ball. He worked very hard on
perfecting his wrong’un, the flipper and the top-spinner. His leg-spinner even had variety
to it, making him one of the most complete tweakers at the time.

His leadership earned him respect immediately. Players loved being guided the
likeable larrikin from Penrith. He looked after everyone both as a team, but also on an
individual basis. His teammates trusted his innovative ideas, while
he trusted them to execute them to the fullest.

For most Australians, summer means cricket. And cricket means hearing the dulcet
tones of their favourite commentator, Richie Benaud. From the cream coloured suit, to the
witty repartee with his colleagues, Benaud is the complete package

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/compare/v0.6...0.7.0) - [Alex Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Blackwell) - 2018-09-03

This release contains JupyterHub version 0.9.2, additional configuration options
and various bug fixes.

**IMPORTANT:** This upgrade will require your users to stop their work at some
point and have their pod restarted. You may want to give them a heads up ahead
of time or do it during nighttime if none are active then.

### Upgrading from v0.6

If you are running `v0.5` of the chart, you should upgrade to `v0.6` first
before upgrading to `0.7.0`. You can find out what version you are using by
running `helm list`.

Follow the steps below to upgrade from `v0.6` to `0.7.0`.

#### 1. (Optional) Ensure the hub's and users' data isn't lost

This step is optional, but a recommended safeguard when the hub's and users'
data is considered important. The changes makes the PersistentVolumes (PVs),
which represent storage (user data and hub database) remain even if the
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) are deleted. The downside of this is that it
requires you to perform manual cleanup of PVs when you want to stop spending
money for the storage.

```sh
# The script is a saftey measure and patches your PersistentVolumes (PV) to
# not be garbage collected if the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) are deleted.
NAMESPACE=<YOUR-NAMESPACE>

# Ensure the hub's and users' data isn't lost
hub_and_user_pvs=($(kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim --no-headers --namespace $NAMESPACE | awk '{print $3}'))
for pv in ${hub_and_user_pvs[@]};
do
    kubectl patch persistentvolume $pv --patch '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'
done
```

#### 2. Update Helm (v2.9.1+ required)

```sh
# Update helm
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash

# Update tiller (on the cluster)
helm init --upgrade --service-account=tiller

# Verify the update
# NOTE: you may need to cancel and re-run the command, it should work within 30
#       seconds.
helm version
# VERIFY: Did it return both the client and server version?
# Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.10.0", GitCommit:"9ad53aac42165a5fadc6c87be0dea6b115f93090", GitTreeState:"clean"}
# Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.10.0", GitCommit:"9ad53aac42165a5fadc6c87be0dea6b115f93090", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

#### 3. (Optional) Clean up pre-puller resources

The pre-puller component of v0.6 could leave leftover resources after it finished,
instead of cleaning up after itself.
This script removes the pre-puller resources created by v0.6.

```sh
# This script will delete resources that were meant to be temporary
# The bug that caused this is fixed in version 0.7.0 of the Helm chart
NAMESPACE=<YOUR-NAMESPACE>

resource_types="daemonset,serviceaccount,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding,job"
for bad_resource in $(kubectl get $resource_types --namespace $NAMESPACE | grep '/pre-pull' | awk '{print $1}');
do
    kubectl delete $bad_resource --namespace $NAMESPACE --now
done

kubectl delete $resource_types --selector hub.jupyter.org/deletable=true --namespace $NAMESPACE --now
```

#### 4. (Recommended) Clean up problematic revisions in your Helm release

This step is recommended due to bugs in Helm that could cause your JupyterHub
Helm chart installation (release) to get stuck in an invalid state.
The symptoms are often that `helm upgrade` commands fail with the reason that some resource does or doesn't exist.

```sh
# Look up the name of your Helm release (installation of a Helm chart)
helm list

# Store the name of the Helm release
RELEASE_NAME=<YOUR-RELEASE-NAME>

# Give yourself an overview of this release's revisions
helm history $RELEASE_NAME

# Check if you have multiple revisions in a DEPLOYED status (a bug), or if you
# have old PENDING_UPGRADES or FAILED revisions (may be problematic).
helm history $RELEASE_NAME | grep --extended-regexp "DEPLOYED|FAILED|PENDING_UPGRADE"

# If you have multiple revisions in DEPLOYED status, this script will clean up
# all configmaps except the latest with DEPLOYED status.
deployed_revisions=($(helm history $RELEASE_NAME | grep DEPLOYED | awk '{print $1}'))
for revision in ${deployed_revisions[@]::${#deployed_revisions[@]}-1};
do
    kubectl delete configmap $RELEASE_NAME.v$revision --namespace kube-system
done

# It seems plausible that upgrade failures could have to do with revisions
# having a PENDING_UPGRADE or FAILED status in the revision history. To delete
# them run the following command.
kubectl delete configmap --selector "NAME=$RELEASE_NAME,STATUS in (FAILED,PENDING_UPGRADE)" --namespace kube-system
```

#### 5. Perform the upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** Do not miss out on the `--force` flag!
`--force` is required due to changes in labelling of jupyterhub resources
in 0.7.
Helm cannot upgrade from the labelling scheme in 0.6 to that in 0.7 without `--force`, which deletes and recreates the deployments.

```sh
RELEASE_NAME=<YOUR-RELEASE-NAME>
NAMESPACE=<YOUR-NAMESPACE>

helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/
helm repo update

# NOTE: We need the --force flag to allow recreation of resources that can't be
#       upgraded to the new state by a patch.
helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME jupyterhub/jupyterhub --install \
    --force \
    --version=0.7.0 \
    --namespace=$NAMESPACE \
    --values config.yaml \
    --timeout 1800
```

#### 6. Manage active users

Active users with running pods must restart their pods. If they don't the next
time they attempt to access their server they may end up with `{“error”:
“invalid_redirect_uri”, “error_description”: “Invalid redirect URI”}`.

You have the power to force this to happen, but it will abort what they are
doing right now. If you want them to be able to do it in their own pace, you
could use the `/hub/admin` path and shut them down manually when they are done.

```
NAMESPACE=<YOUR-NAMESPACE>

# Inspect what users are currently running
kubectl get pod --selector component=singleuser-server --namespace $NAMESPACE

# Force all of them to shutdown their servers, and ensure the hub gets to
# realize that happened through a restart.
kubectl delete pod --selector component=singleuser-server --namespace $NAMESPACE
kubectl delete pod --selector component=hub --namespace $NAMESPACE
```

#### Troubleshooting - Cleanup of cluster

If things fail, you can try the following before installing the chart. If you
decide to take these steps, we recommend step 1 is taken first in order to not
loose data and that you ensure the old data is made available by the
troubleshooting step below.

```sh
RELEASE_NAME=<YOUR-RELEASE-NAME>

# WARNING: Deletes everything installed by the Helm chart!
# WARNING: If you have not changed the reclaim policy of the hub in step 1, the
#          hub never be able to remember anything about past users. Also note
#          that even if you have taken step 1, you must also make the PVs become
#          `Available` again before the hub starts up again.
# NOTE: This does not include user pods or user storage PVCs as they have been
#       indirectly created by KubeSpawner
helm delete $RELEASE_NAME --purge

# WARNING: Deletes everything within the namespace!
# WARNING: If you have not changed the reclaim policy of the hub and users in
#          step 1, the hub's stored information about the users and the user's
#          storage will be lost forever. Also note that even if you have taken
#          step 1, you must also make the hub and users PVs become `Available`
#          before the hub and users startup again.
kubectl delete namespace <YOUR-NAMESPACE>
```

If you took these steps and step 1, you should probably right now continue with
the next troubleshooting section about making `Released` PVs `Available` for
reuse.

#### Troubleshooting - Make `Released` PVs `Available` for reuse

If you followed step 1 and 2, you can after cleanup of a cluster reuse the old
hub's and users' storage if you do this step before you installs the Helm chart
again.

In more technical words: if you have deleted PVCs such as `hub-db-dir` or
`claim-anyusername`, their PVs will end in a `Released` state assuming they had
a `reclaimPolicy` set to `Retain`. To make use of these PVs again, we must make
them `Available` for the to future PVCs that needs a PV to bind to.

```sh
NAMESPACE=<YOUR-NAMESPACE>

# Ensure the hub's and users' PVs are made `Available` again
hub_and_user_pvs=($(kubectl get persistentvolume | grep -E "Released.+$NAMESPACE/(hub-db-dir|claim-)" | awk '{print $1}'))
for pv in ${hub_and_user_pvs[@]};
do
    kubectl patch persistentvolume $pv --patch '{"spec":{"claimRef":{"uid":null}}}}'
done

# Ensure you don't have any PVCs in the lost state
lost_pvcs=($(kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim --namespace $NAMESPACE | grep -E "(hub-db-dir|claim-).+Lost" | awk '{print $1}'))
for pvc in ${lost_pvcs[@]};
do
    echo kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaim $pvc --namespace $NAMESPACE
done
```

## [0.6] - [Ellyse Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellyse_Perry) - 2017-01-29

This release is primarily focused on better support
for Autoscaling, Microsoft Azure support & better
default security. There are also a number of bug fixes
and configurability improvements!

### Breaking changes

#### Pre-puller configuration
In prior versions (v0.5), if you wanted to disable the pre-puller,
you would use:

```yaml
prePuller:
  enabled: false
```

Now, to disable the pre-puller, you need to use:

```yaml
prePuller:
  hook:
    enabled: false
```

See the [pre-puller docs](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#pre-pulling-images-for-faster-startup) for more info!

### Upgrading from 0.5

This release does not require any special steps to upgrade from v0.5. See the [upgrade documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading.html)
for general upgrading steps.

If you are running v0.4 of the chart, you should upgrade to v0.5 first
before upgrading to v0.6. You can find out what version you are using
by running `helm list`.

#### Troubleshooting

If your helm upgrade fails due to the error `no Ingress with the name "jupyterhub-internal" found`,
you may be experiencing a [helm bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/3275). To work
around this, run `kubectl --namespace=<YOUR-NAMESPACE> delete ingress jupyterhub-internal` and
re-run the `helm upgrade` command. Note that this will cause a short unavailability of your hub
over HTTPS, which will resume normal availability once the deployment upgrade completes.

### New Features

#### More secure by default

z2jh is more secure by default with 0.6. We now
block access to cloud security metadata endpoints by
default.

See the [security documentation](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html) for more details. It has seen a number of improvements, and we recommend
you read through it!

#### Autoscaling improvements

Some cloud providers support the [kubernetes node autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler),
which can add / remove nodes depending on how much your
cluster is being used. In this release, we made a few
changes to let z2jh interact better with the autoscaler!

- Configure z2jh to ['pack' your users](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html#picking-a-scheduler-strategy)
  onto nodes, rather than 'spread' them across nodes.
- A ['continuous' pre-puller](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html?highlight=prepull#pre-pulling-images-for-faster-startup)
  that allows user images to
  be pulled on new nodes easily, leading to faster startup
  times for users on new nodes. ([link])
- Hub and Proxy pod will not be disrupted by autoscaler,
  by using [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)s. The Hub & Proxy will also stick
  together if possible, thus minimizing the number of nodes
  that can not be downsized by the autoscaler.

There is more work to be done for good autoscaling support,
but this is a good start!

#### Better Azure support

Azure's new managed Kubernetes service ([AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)) is much
better supported by this version!

- We have much better documentation on using z2jh with Azure!
- We rewrote our pre-puller so it works on Azure (previously it did not)

Azure AKS is still in preview mode, so be aware of that
before using it in any production workloads!

See the [setting up Kubernetes on Microsoft AKS](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create-k8s-cluster.html#setting-up-kubernetes-on-microsoft-azure-container-service-aks) section for more information.

#### Better configurability

We now have better documentation and bug fixes for configurability!

- `extraConfig` can be a dictionary instead of just a
  string. This helps when you have to split your `config.yaml`
  into multiple files for complex deployments
- How user storage works by default is [better documented](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-storage.html)
- Reading config in `extraConfig` from `extraConfigMap` now actually works!
- You can configure the URL that users are directed to after they log in.
  This allows [defaulting users to JupyterLab](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-environment.html#use-jupyterlab-by-default)
- You can pre-pull multiple images now, for custom configuration that needs multiple images
- [Better instructions](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-environment.html#pre-populating-user-s-home-directory-with-files)
  on pre-populating your user's filesystem using [nbgitpuller](https://github.com/data-8/nbgitpuller)

### [Ellyse Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellyse_Perry)

_(excerpt from https://www.cricket.com.au/players/ellyse-perry/1aMxKNyEOUiJqhq7N5Tlwg)_

Arguably the best athlete in Australia, Ellyse Perry’s profile continues to rise
with the dual cricket and soccer international having played World Cups for both sports.

Perry became the youngest Australian ever to play senior international cricket when
she made her debut in the second ODI of the Rose Bowl Series in Darwin in July 2007
before her 17th birthday.

She went on to make her domestic debut in the 2007-08 Women’s National Cricket League
season, taking 2-29 from 10 overs in her first match.

Since her national debut, Perry has become a regular fixture for the Southern Stars,
playing in the 2009 ICC Women’s World Cup and the ICC Women’s World Twenty20 in the same year.

Leading Australia’s bowling attack, Perry played a crucial role in the ICC Women’s
World Twenty20 Final in the West Indies in 2010.

The match came down to the wire, with New Zealand requiring five runs off the last
ball to claim the title. Under immense pressure, Perry bowled the final ball of the
tournament, which New Zealand’s Sophie Devine struck straight off the bat.

The talented footballer stuck out her boot to deflect the ball to Lisa Sthalekar at
mid-on, securing the trophy for Australia. Perry’s figures of 3-18 in the final saw
her take home the Player of the Match award.

Perry featured prominently in Australia's three-peat of World T20 victories,
selected for the Team of the Tournament in 2012 and 2014.

She was named [ICC Female Cricketer of the Year](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-22/ellyse-perry-named-iccs-womens-cricketer-of-the-year/9280538) in 2017.

## [0.5] - [Hamid Hassan](http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/player/311427.html) - 2017-12-05

JupyterHub 0.8, HTTPS & scalability.

### Upgrading from 0.4

See the [upgrade documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading.html) for upgrade steps.

### New Features

#### JupyterHub 0.8

JupyterHub 0.8 is full of new features - see [CHANGELOG](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.1/changelog.html#id1)
for more details. Specific features made to benefit this chart are:

1. No more 'too many redirects' errors at scale.
2. Lots of performance improvements, we now know we can handle up to 4k active users
3. Concurrent spawn limits (set via `hub.concurrentSpawnLimit`) can be used to limit the concurrent
   number of users who can try to launch on the hub at any given time. This can be
   tuned to avoid crashes when hundreds of users try to launch at the same time. It gives
   them a friendly error message + asks them to try later, rather than spinning forever.
4. Active Server limit (set via `hub.activeServerLimit`) can be used to limit the
   total number of active users that can be using the hub at any given time. This allows
   admins to control the size of their clusters.
5. Memory limits & guarantees (set via `singleuser.memory`) can now contain fractional
   units. So you can say `0.5G` instead of having to use `512M`.

And lots more!

#### Much easier HTTPS

It is our responsibility as software authors to make it very easy for admins to set up
HTTPS for their users. v0.5 makes this much easier than v0.4. You can find the new
instructions [here](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending-jupyterhub.html#setting-up-https) and
they are much simpler!

You can also now use your own HTTPS certificates & keys rather than using Let's Encrypt.

#### More authenticators supported

The following new authentication providers have been added:

1. GitLab
2. CILogon
3. Globus

You can also set up a whitelist of users by adding to the list in `auth.whitelist.users`.


#### Easier customization of `jupyterhub_config.py`

You can always put extra snippets of `jupyterhub_config.py` configuration in
`hub.extraConfig`. Now you can also add extra environment variables to the hub
in `hub.extraEnv` and extra configmap items via `hub.extraConfigMap`. ConfigMap
items can be arbitrary YAML, and you can read them via the `get_config` function in
your `hub.extraConfig`. This makes it cleaner to customize the hub's config in
ways that's not yet possible with config.yaml.

#### Hub Services support

You can also add [external JupyterHub Services](http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services.html)
by adding them to `hub.services`. Note that you are still responsible for actually
running the service somewhere (perhaps as a deployment object).

#### More customization options for user server environments

More options have been added under `singleuser` to help you customize the environment
that the user is spawned in. You can change the uid / gid of the user with `singleuser.uid`
and `singleuser.fsGid`, mount extra volumes with `singleuser.storage.extraVolumes` &
`singleuser.storage.extraVolumeMounts` and provide extra environment variables with
`singleuser.extraEnv`.

### Hamid Hassan

Hamid Hassan is a fast bowler who currently plays for the Afghanistan National
Cricket Team. With nicknames ranging from
["Afghanistan's David Beckham"](https://www.rferl.org/a/interview-afghan-cricketer-living-the-dream/24752618.html) to
["Rambo"](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11413633),
he is considered by many to be Afghanistan's first Cricket Superhero. Currently
known for fast (145km/h+) deliveries, cartwheeling celebrations, war painted
face and having had to flee Afghanistan as a child to escape from war. He [says](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11413633)
he plays because "We are ambassadors for our country and we want to show the
world that Afghanistan is not like people recognise it by terrorists and these
things. We want them to know that we have a lot of talent as well"

## [0.4] - [Akram](#akram) - 2017-06-23

Stability, HTTPS & breaking changes.

### Installation and upgrades

We **recommend** that you delete prior versions of the package and install the
latest version. If you are very familiar with Kubernetes, you can upgrade from
an older version, but we still suggest deleting and recreating your
installation.

### Breaking changes

* The **name of a user pod** and a **dynamically created home directory [PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)** no longer include
  the `userid` in them by default. If you are using dynamic PVCs for `home`
  directories (which is the default), you will need to *manually rename* these
  directories before upgrading.
  Otherwise, new PVCs will be created, and users might freak out when viewing the newly created directory and think that their home directory appears empty.

  See [PR #56](https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/56) on
  what needs to change.

* A **[StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#storageclasses)**
  is no longer created by default. This shouldn't affect most new installs,
  since most cloud provider installations have a default (as of Kubernetes 1.6).
  If you are using an older version of Kubernetes, the easiest thing to do is to
  upgrade to a newer version. If not, you can create a StorageClass manually
  and everything should continue to work.

* `token.proxy` is removed. Use **`proxy.secretToken`** instead.
  If your `config.yaml` contains something that looks like the following:

  ```yaml
  token:
      proxy: <some-secret>
  ```

  you should change that to:

  ```yaml
  proxy:
      secretToken: <some-secret>
  ```

### Added

* Added **GitHub Authentication support**, thanks to [Jason Kuruzovich](https://github.com/jkuruzovich).
* Added **[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) support**!
  If your cluster already has Ingress support (with automatic Let's Encrypt support, perhaps),
  you can easily use that now.
* We now add a **label** to user pods / PVCs with their usernames.
* Support using a **static PVC** for user `home` directories or for the hub database. This makes this release usable
  with clusters where you only have one NFS share that must be used for the whole hub.
* **PostgreSQL** is now a supported hub database backend provider.
* You can set annotations & labels on the **proxy-public service** now.

### Changed

* We now use the official [configurable http proxy](http://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy)
  (CHP) as the proxy, rather than the unofficial
  [nchp](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-nginx-chp). This should be a
  no-op (or require no changes) for the most part. JupyterHub errors might
  display a nicer error page.
* The version of KubeSpawner uses the official Kubernetes
  [python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/) rather
  than [pycurl](http://pycurl.io/). This helps with scalability a little.

### Removed

* The deprecated `createNamespace` parameter no longer works, alongside the
  deprecated `name` parameter. You probably weren't using these anyway - they
  were kept only for backwards compatibility with very early versions.
